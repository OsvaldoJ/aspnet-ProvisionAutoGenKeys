# ProvisionAutoGenKeys

This program is a hopefully-exact replication of the [ASP.NET 5 DataProtection](https://github.com/aspnet/DataProtection/) PowerShell script **Provision-AutoGenKeys.ps1** available [here](https://github.com/aspnet/DataProtection/blob/dev/Provision-AutoGenKeys.ps1). Except that it is written in C# and compiles into an actual application making it usable on systems without PowerShell 3.
